                    <p>
                        A project proposal also called a "statement of work" is defined as a detailed description of a series of 
                        activities aimed at solving a certain problem (NEBIU 2002). A project proposal is a prerequisite to achieve 
                        success in whatever project you plan to do. The first step in planning is choosing the project to be done. 
                        In deciding for any project, answer first the following questions:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Will I and other people appreciate this project?</li>
                        <li>Is this project beneficial?</li>
                        <li>Is this project economical?</li>
                        <li>Are the materials to be used available?</li>
                        <li>Can I follow the steps in making this project?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The following are the parts of a project proposal:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Title</b> - talks about the title of the project, team name and individual member names, date, and the picture of the project.</li>
                        <li><b>Rationale</b> - brief statement of the project, procedures employed to carry out the project, and the project outcome.</li>
                        <li><b>Objectives</b> - talks about the goal or purpose of the project.</li>
                        <li><b>Design Drawing or Illustration</b> - shows the design of the project.</li>
                        <li><b>Project Organization and Management</b> - tells how the project will be handled. This includes the task 
                            phases from planning to production, division of responsibilities, and duties of each team member.</li>
                        <li><b>Budget</b> - tells how much is to be spent for the whole project to finish.</li>

                    <p><b>Rationale</b>:</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:50px">
                        Basketry refers to the art and craft of creating containers, usually in the form of baskets, by weaving 
                        flexible plant materials or other materials together. It is a technique that has been practiced by various 
                        cultures throughout history, utilizing natural materials such as grasses, reeds, branches, and bark strips. 
                        Basketry serves both functional and decorative purposes, providing a means to carry, store, and organize items, 
                        as well as serving as artistic expressions. The weaving techniques used in basketry can vary, including coiling, 
                        plaiting, twining, and stake and strand weaving, among others. Basketry is a versatile craft that encompasses 
                        a wide range of styles and designs, reflecting the cultural traditions and creativity of different societies.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent:50px">
                        This project gives the students an opportunity to discover a lot of things about basketry. As they go along creating 
                        things using basketry, they will also discover that it can be a great source of income, which does not require many 
                        supplies or tools.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>III. Objectives</b>:</p>

                        <li>Make a basket.</li>
                        <li>Develop industry and love for work.</li>
                        <li>Apply one's aesthetic sense in making a basket.</li>

                            -  <i>Finishing</i> is done by painting, varnishing, or polishing the final product.
                            -  <i>Inspection</i> makes sure that the operation has been carried out correctly as to the specified quality and quantity of the product.
                            -  <i>Packaging</i> makes sure that the product is protected and ready for sale.

                            There will be profit when total contribution exceeds total fixed cost.

                    <p><b>Computing for Cost and Selling Price</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Price setting seems to be an easy thing to do; yet it is one of the most crucial aspects of marketing. Price is the value placed on 
                        goods and services offered to the public.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic method in setting the price of your product is cost-oriented pricing. Under this method, all costs are added and divided 
                        by the number of products produced in order to arrive at the selling price of a single product or unit. Markup refers to the margin 
                        of difference between the cost price and the selling price.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>List down all the costs of materials that were used in making your product.</li>
                        <li>List down the operational expenses like labor cost, transportation, electricity, etc.</li>
                        <li>Add all expenses in steps 1 and 2. This is your total cost.</li>
                        <li>Multiply the sum in step 3 by .40 if the desired profit is 40%. This is your profit.</li>
                        <li>Add the product of step 4 to the sum of step 3. This is your selling price.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Evaluation of a finished product is important in assessing one's learning. It will tell whether 
                        your outputs are excellent, satisfactory, or poor. It also gives you feedback on the aspects 
                        you need to improve in order to produce better work next time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evaluation is done in many ways. The use of rubric is a helpful tool to use in evaluating 
                        student progress and learning after each lesson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evaluation using a rubric can be done by you, a classmate, or your teacher. The more people 
                        are involved in the evaluation process, the more accurate and reliable the result will be.
