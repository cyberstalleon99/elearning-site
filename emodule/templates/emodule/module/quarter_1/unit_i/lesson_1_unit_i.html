                    <p>
                        Macrame’ and basketry products are wonderful and delightful crafts that
                        are useful from bags and hanging baskets to purely decorative objects like jewelry
                        and wall hangings
                    </p>

                    <h6>Cultural and Economic Importance</h6>

                    <p><b>Macrame</b> - come in various designs and styles. The famous style is
                        macramé Y-shaped necklaces. By varying the knots, the position, and the
                        kind of gemstone used, several one-of-a kind designer necklaces are produced. Macrame chokers
                        that come with semi-precious stones and freshwater pearls are created.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Macrame’ Earrings</b> - are light and various sizes and shapes</p>
                    <p><b>Macrame’ Bracelets</b> - are made of nylon-waxed twine; are light to wear in contrast to
                        silver, gold, and traditional jewelry with crystals and gemstone.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Macrame’ Textiles</b> - is a form of textile making using knots instead of weaving
                        or knitting. It is similar to crochet or Chinese knotting, which is used to create intricate
                        textiles. A variety of macramé called cavandolimacrame’ is used
                        to form geometric patterns especially in weaving.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Chinese Macrame’</b> - is used to decorate the palace halls and country households in China
                        since the ancient times. Chinese macrame’ has also appeared
                        in paintings and other pieces of folk art. Royalties in China had their chairs,
                        lady’s dresses, mirrors, pouches, eyeglasses, fans, and Buddhist rosaries
                        decorated with macrame’. Chinese macramé is ornamental and of immense
                        aesthetic value. Complicated Chinese macramé allows all kinds of variations
                        that enhance its decorative value
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Macrame' Bags</b> - are fashion accessories now a days, trendy style made of
                        beads or sequences

                    <h6>Basketry Technique</h6>
                    <p><b>Coiled Basketry</b> is a type of technique in basket making, which is Native
                        Americans of the Southwest are well renowned for. This comes in various
                        styles and shapes depending on the materials used and the type of stitch
                        used to interlock the coil together.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Plaiting Basketry</b> is like to textile weaving where the material is plaited or
                        woven to produce a wide variety of items like bags, basket, purse, fan, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Twining Basketry</b> uses materials from roots and tree bark. Twining refers to a
                        weaving technique where two or more flexible weaving elements through
                        the stiffer radial spokes.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Wicker and Splint Basketry</b> uses materials like reed, cane, willow, oak, and
                        ash to create useful basket designs.

                    <h5>Different Kinds of Macrame Knots</h5><br>
                    <p>
                        Macrame has been a popular way to decorate , bringing texture and warmth
                        into a home with knots that can be put together in unique ways in order to create
                        one-of-a-kind wall hangings, plant holders, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good variety in texture and design can result from the arrangement of
                        just a few knots. The two basic knots used in macramé are the half knot and the
                        half hitch. Other macramé knots are mostly derived from these two. The flat knot
                        consist of two half knots (one regular, one reverse) and can be used as is or with
                        a space left in between to produce the butterfly effect. With slight variations, it
                        makes the inside out square knot and alternating square knot. Cording is the
                        other most used knot made up of rows of double half hitches.

                    <p>
                        Basketry is a craft or process of making baskets or objects woven like baskets from plants and
                        synthetic materials.
                    </p>

                    </ul>

                    <h6>TERMS TO REMEMBER</h6>
                    <p><b>Weavers.</b>These are the basket strands that weave through the spokes; they are
                        lighter, thinner and more flexible than the spokes to enable them to be woven in
                        and out.</p>
                    <p><b>Spokes.</b>These are the strands that stand upright and form the side supports of
                        the basket; they are much stiffer than the weavers and are strong.</p>
                    <p><b>Warp.</b>The set of parallel bamboo strips that provide a basis for weaving patterns.
                        In plane bamboo weaving, the warp strips are positioned vertically on the workbench.</p>
                    <p><b>Weft.</b>Made up of the bamboo strips that are inserted perpendicularly under and
                        over the warp to create a design. In plane bamboo, weaving the weft strips are positioned
                        horizontally on the workbench.</p>

                    <h6>Basketry Weaving Techniques</h6>
                    <p>There are four basic techniques used to weave a basket. These are stake
                        and strand, coiling, plaiting and twining. The use of these four techniques creates
                        a variety of different types of useful products from small to big basket.</p>

                    <b>1. Stake and Strand</b>
                    <p>Stake and strand weaving involve two elements: the rigid stakes that form the ribs or warp and a more or the weft. 
                        This method allows the use of a wide range of materials as long as they are flexible enough for the weft and rigid enough for the warp.
                        <img src="{% static 'emodule/images/module/quarter_1/unit_i/unit_i_14.png' %}">
                    </p>
                    <b>2. Coiling/ Coiled Basketry</b>
                    <p>Believed to be the earliest basketry techniques used. This method is usually employed for softer materials such as grasses. 
                        Strands of grass are stitched together to form a spiral that is forced into a basket shape. The base material is usually a straw, willow,
                        palmetto or yucca, while raffia and horse hair are stitched together using a straw.
                        <img src="{% static 'emodule/images/module/quarter_1/unit_i/unit_i_15.png' %}">
                    </p>
                    <b>3. Plaiting</b>
                    <p>Plaited weaving involves weaving wide materials, similar in shape to ribbons, such as palm, yucca, or flax. Both the stakes as well as
                        the weaving materials are identical, which are then woven together at right angle. The plaiting can be either open or closed. By using 
                        variations of the basic plaiting methods as well as the wide range of materials available means that each basket can be a unique masterpiece.
                        <img src="{% static 'emodule/images/module/quarter_1/unit_i/unit_i_16.png' %}">
                    </p>
                    <b>4. Twining</b>
                    <p>Twine weaving refers to using multiple materials, one that is more rigid at the base and another two that are more flexible at the sides of
                        the basket. Twining is similar to weaving but two strands are used to go under and over the ribs. Baskets made by twining can be quite
                        spectacular because 3 or more materials can be used to twine a basket. In twining basketry, you need to be quite experienced as the
                        strands have to be woven over and under the ribs in opposite directions. There are also many variations to twining such as leaving the
                        warp open or twining on the diagonal.
